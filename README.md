# Introduction

__Number Theory__ is important for competitive programming because it provides essential mathematical tools to efficiently solve problems related to __integers__, __primes__, __divisibility__, and __modular arithmetic__. It enables programmers to optimize algorithms, handle mathematical operations with integers, and design efficient solutions for a wide range of computational problems.
