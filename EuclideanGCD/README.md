> __GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)__ or __HCF (Highest Common Factor)__ of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both of the numbers.

## Fastest way to compute GCD

The fastest way to find the __Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)__ of two numbers is by using the __Euclidean algorithm__. The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient and widely used method for __GCD__ calculation. It used to compute __GCD__ of two numbers in O(log(min(a,b)).

It uses recursion to repeatedly replace __a__ with __b__ and __b__ with the remainder of __a__ divided by __b__ until __b__ becomes __zero__, returning a as the __GCD__. This approach is concise and efficient for __GCD__ calculation.

## Problems identification that involve GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) problems can vary in complexity and application, but they generally involve finding the greatest common divisor of one or more integers or applying GCD properties to solve a specific problem. Here are some common types of problems that involve GCD:

- Problems that require to determine __if one number is divisible by another__ may involve GCD, as GCD is related to the greatest common factor of two numbers.
- Many number theory problems which related to __coprime numbers__, __relatively prime numbers__, or __Eulerâ€™s totient function__, involve GCD calculation.
- Consider whether the problem hints about the need to factorize numbers into their prime factors. GCD problems sometimes involve __prime factorization__ to find __common factors__ efficiently.
- In graph theory, GCD can be used in problems related to __connected components__, in which a edge between the nodes will only exist if they are not __co-prime__.
